*Bringing Process Modeling to the Blockchain*

Writing smart contracts in C++ and deploying them to a blockchain, is not everybodies cup of tea. Eos-commons.io aims to bridge the gap between your conceptual process model and a smart contract executed on a block chain.

**Work in progress!**

# Features
### Process Universe
eos-commons is built around a class model that encompasses all processes. At the highest level it includes accounts and resources. Resources includes things like pages, views, processes, states etc.
### Extensible
The model is fully extensible meaning, users can add their own classes and objects that inherit from existing classes. They do so in their own space. 
### Page, views, queries
Our highly flexible page model allows users to drill down through the the data graph, in a master-detal fashion.
### EOS Blockchain
- We use the eosio data store as a nosql data base.
- When processes are executed the state changes are recorded on the blockchain.
- We take advantage of eosio's authorization to guaranteeÂ secure transactions.
### 3D Diagrams
Really cool 3D diagrams that represent various aspects of the model: class model process model, workflow model etc.

### Demo
These demos are based on static data, not the blockchain
